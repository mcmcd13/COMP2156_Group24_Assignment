I intentionally spaced out my commits in order to ensure I could experience the process of merging other updates in while creating my own work.

But surprisingly the assignment got submitting midday a day early while I was updating my personal branch with the new changes in main.

I figured that less active members like Harsh might have some work to add in last minute, so I wanted to make sure that opportunity existed.

There was never any intention to submit early due to the fact that several members were far behind on their progress. It would not make sense to cut the project off before the last day, as they could technically still contribute before the due date.

## Project Description
In this first assignment, we work as a group to make a GitHub Repo, commit to our branches, and work through various merges. In the process at least three files should be created per group member, and a README should be updated with repo details and group information.
Responsibilities vary slightly from group member to group member.

## Instructions
After finding a group of people, set up a repo, add collaborators, initialize on each device, and then work together to slowly update your collective repo to fulfill all requirements.

## CI/CD Details
GitHub Actions .yml file configured for basic GitHub action automation, such as what happens on Push and sample messages when certain automated tasks are fulfilled.

## Branching Strategy
We use a simple branch strategy in which each collaborator as well as the leader starts their own branch. These branches should be labeled with their name and student ID.
In addition to unique branches for each collaborator, the Main branch is shared by every member, and it should be regularly updated with merges.

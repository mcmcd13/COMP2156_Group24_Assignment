## Lab 1
Our first lab was simple, but learning to initialize git properly was good to set up for future tasks.
I had to backtrack and write down the config tips later when future labs failed to push properly.

## Lab 2
Keeping good documentation is essential in group work. It is near-impossible to get things done when nobody knows what the others are doing
It was interesting learning that git pull was basically a fusion of git fetch and git merge. I was curious as to why somebody would use fetch without planning to merge afterwards.

## Lab 3
Travis CI was a pain to get running. When I saw that it required a credit card, I switched to GitHub Actions.
Still, it was good to know that multiple options exist.

## Lab 4
Configuring NodeJS and GitHub actions was surprisingly simple. I thought there'd be more hoops to jump through, but it turned out to be some simple scripting.
I didn't realize that GitHub could be used to run simple programs until this lab.

## Lab 5
Using GitHub to run simple single page apps was an expansion of the previous lab. In retrospect, many simple online apps that I make use of were probably set up in the same way.
I started working on a small app for procedural generation after this.

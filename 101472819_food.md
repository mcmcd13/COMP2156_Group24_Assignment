Vesta Lunch, Rapido Coffee, Typist Studios, First and Last Coffee,
Krispy Kreme, Chilliy Pepper TACOS
### Vesta Lunch
Vesta Lunch is a spot with some history. Their food is better than any of the cafes along the street, but that isn't anything to write home about. The price is too high compared to the quality.
### Rapido Coffee
Their space has a good vibe and plenty of room. Like most cafes in the area, their food consists of reheated sandwiches and a handful of desserts. 
Their coffee is around 5-10$. Not worth the money.
### Typist Studios
A decent space with a good selection of coffee and tea. The only real drawback is that they close on Mondays.
### First and Last Coffee
A first choice for coffee (their name is pretty fitting). 
Unfortunately, plenty of people seem to agree with this assessment, so they are usually packed. Best to swing by in the morning on your way to campus.
### Krispy Kreme
A coffee and donuts chain restaurant from the States. Their donuts aren't worth mentioning, and their coffee isn't that good either.
But its also a touch cheaper than the other places, and its right next to the subway station. All in all, its a good enough option.
### Chilliy Pepper TACOS
Probably the best place in the area. Their tacos are only 5$ despite good quality. While the selection isn't massive, the food is well made and well served.
I don't recommend buying their sauce, the portion is a bit too small.
